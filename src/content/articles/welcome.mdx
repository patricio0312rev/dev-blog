## TL;DR

Starting a dev blog to share what I learn, rant about the industry, and hopefully help some folks along the way.

## Why Another Dev Blog?

Pues, here's the thing — I've been coding for years and I keep running into the same problems, learning the same lessons, and having the same "aha!" moments.

So this is that. Me telling you about the stuff I wish someone had told me.

## What You'll Find Here

Three types of content:

- **🔥 Trending** — Industry news, new releases, hot takes
- **📚 Tutorials** — Practical how-tos with real code
- **🔬 Deep Dives** — SOLID principles, design patterns, architecture

## My Take

I'm not going to pretend to be neutral. If I think a pattern is overengineered, I'll say so.

Nos vemos! 🚀
