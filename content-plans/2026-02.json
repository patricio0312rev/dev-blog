As of early 2026, MCP has 97M+ monthly SDK downloads and is supported in Claude, ChatGPT, VS Code, Cursor, and many other platforms. The latest spec (2025-11-25) includes async operations, statelessness, and server identity features. Official SDKs exist for TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java.

The METR study showed that while developers believe AI makes them faster, autonomous systems need careful design to actually improve productivity.

However, a July 2025 METR study found that while developers believed AI made them 20% faster, objective tests showed they were actually 19% slower. AI tools excel at boilerplate code, writing tests, fixing bugs, and explaining unfamiliar code. Security is a major concern — AI tools trained on historical repos lack real-time CVE awareness.
